1) Once extracted you can open index.html in google-chrome(I developed in
   google-chrome and I am not aware of compatibility with other
   browsers).
2) From the webpage load a Seaview instrumented log file(in the top
   right corner), in this very folder you can find muse.log.
3) Once the webpage is loaded you can check or uncheck <Hide
   tags> or <Show only instrumented logs> that may enhance your
   understanding.
4) The log file being displayed should be color coded. It will show
   the instrumented values in colors while same color correspond to same
   dimension.
5) There are total two selection inputs in the page right now.
6) The first selection input:(from left)
   all the selection inputs except Plot will group i.e. will be in
   group mode. When you click on any of the colored instrumented
   value, it will group the similar values according to the input in
   the first selection input.
   Once you went into the group mode for the whole log to be displayed
   again check/uncheck show only Instrumented logs(This now is like a
   reset button.)
7) plot mode of first selection input:
   When in this mode, click on any colored value will plot the value
   over time.
   There is a critical bug over here please bear with me while I
   resolve them.
   a) It does n't bother if you have clicked on a value with
      appropriate value signature.(i.e. numerical)
   b) Once you have generated a bar chart then you cannot generate
      any more.(WAT!)
8) Second selection input:
   Well this isn't developed yet.
