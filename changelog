changelog on comparision with master.
This version-2.3 is modified to address all the issues in Milestone:2.3.
1) The index page is redesigned to what is supposed to be a better one.(The menu is hidden, movements were made smooth,
   log text is now restricted to its own scroll. Basically tried to use the space more efficiently.)
2) Mapping from log file to scatter plot.
3) horizontal lines were added to scatter plot, to ease the reading of values.
