The foremost thing to do now is to change the unifi file anmd generate a log file that is not very huge.
1) We should have an idea of how big a log file we are dealing with or some constraints on how big we can deal can also help.
2) By generating the js scripts firefox is throwing the error: "Array initialiser is too large." this has to be fixed.
3) May be the things should be made more efficient as it is taking really long to load the scatter plot or line-chart making it atleast o(nlnn) would help.
4) Making count as the factor for radius of circle is just not enough and hence is better to have no factor and make it the same for all the var's.
